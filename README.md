# Java_Sample_3
Short Assignment_301
Objective:
Able to install the compilation, execution environment and write the first java program.

Run an application based on Java technology from the command line

Exercise 1 
Create a project named “JPE.S.A201” and a new package called exercise1.

Write a program called SumAverageRunningInt in exercise1 to produce the sum of 1, 2, 3, ..., to 100. Store 1 and 100 in variables lowerbound and upperbound, so that we can change their values easily. Also compute and display the average.

Expected Output :

Average of all 100 first numbers: 50.0

 

Exercise 2 
In project “JPE.S.A201” create a new package called exercise2, after that create a class named ArrayContains:

Enter length and elements of a string array “stringArray”
Require to enter a string variable “sValue”
Print “Contained” if Array contains “sValue”, or “No Contain” otherwise.
Test Data:

              stringArray = {"FTP","Fresher", "Acedemy", "2018"};

Expected Output

          Check 'Fresher' in Array: Contained!

 

Exercise 3 
In project “JPE.S.A201” create a new package called exercise3, after that create a class named FrequentNumber:

Declare an int arrray and a variable ‘len’. Ask user to enter length of Array
Continuing to require users enter a value for an element of Array, repeating this work until Array is full or user chooses “N/n” if asked “Do you want to continue?”
Enter an int value stored to ‘value’ variable, write java code to count frequency of the value in Array, prints amount and positions.
Hints: Use do..while to enter elements of Array

Test Data:

              int[] intArray = new int[5]; //  5     7      5      8       3

       int value = 5;     

Expected Output

          Amount of frequence: 2

Indexs: 0    2

 

 

Exercise 4 
In project “JPE.S.A201” create a new package called exercise4, after that create a class named ArrayReverse:

Initialize an integer array. Array example:
int[] myIntArray = { 43, 32, 53, 23, 12, 34, 3, 12, 43, 32 };

Write a Java code to reverse the array contents. Prints Array before and after conversion.s
Test Data:

              int[] myIntArray = { 43, 32, 53, 23, 12, 34, 3, 12, 43, 32 };

Expected Output

          Original Array: 43, 32, 53, 23, 12, 34, 3, 12, 43, 32

       Reversed Array: 32, 43, 12, 3, 34, 12, 23, 53, 32, 43s

 

Problem Descriptions:
Write a java console program to resolve this assignment
Guidelines:
Create a project named JPE.S.A201, create packages as required that contains the above classes.
